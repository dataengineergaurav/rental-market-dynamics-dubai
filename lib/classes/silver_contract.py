"""Silver contract layer for Dubai Ejari rent registrations.

Validates each registration, derives contract facts, and produces stable
keys. Never raises on a bad row: violations are collected on the instance so
the pipeline stays fail-open (ADR-03) and the 1-registration grain (ADR-02)
is preserved.
